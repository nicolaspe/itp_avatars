# Me as myself
**Final project proposal**

Performative Avatars, fall 2018 @ NYU's ITP


### Questions

Why do we give so much weight to the way culture shapes us? We do we impose THAT expression over what we want for ourselves?
>  It is also my hope to reduce this violence by widening the field of possibility and therefore the field of understanding


> Through “passing”, or being “read” or perceived as one's chosen gender

How does that affect me? My representation? How I choose to do it? Does it make **me** less valid?

> The night I was driven home from the end of the performance, we
thought for a moment that a cop was following us. My concern for my own well being, what I was currently wearing and
how that might be perceived by a cop or in jail crossed my mind. Within minutes, the real life danger of being
transgender had returned. Still, this experience is tiny when compared to the violence people are suffering in the Gaza
strip, in part because of their identities and positionalities.

In the end, the danger from the real world comes from bigotry and nothing else. Standing up to them is up to us: those willing to do it and with the energy to do so, until they cannot or want not. Self care is always more important.

> there are many people who want to become their avatars

because this world actually sucks.

> Further still, we already are our avatars. It is a mistake to
think that there is an endpoint to becoming. Everyday as we inhabit these digital bodies in Second Life, we temporarily inhabit a mode of being these avatars

We act and wear thousands of masks
