# versions of myself

## 1: base scan
this is my body. or it was at that moment. it has no beard, where I usually wear one. I wanted the distance. This is not me, it represents me, but it's not. See them all you like, it's missing too many pieces. It barely represents the person it's supposed to.

I have always struggled with masculinity, because I reject the value of such a ???. I have a "strong feminine side". bullshit from society.
The moment I realized how much toxic masculinity screwed my life I had to stop walking. I was on the street and sought somewhere to sit down as all the pieces fell together. I didn't conform, and I still don't. I refuse.
but still... I do. and I feel closer to side. and I embrace it more than the other one.

... but why me? why represent myself in a virtual space? does this body hold that much value it needs to be translated into the digital realm?
should I translate my body as it is?
can I amplify it? is there any value in doing so? can I perfect it? can I get rid of that which I hate?

finally, there's one representation missing: the body itself. so here I am. The physical representation, the embodiment of my persona. Inside this fully textured and sometimes functional avatar you can find the essence of Nicolas. It's there, muddled between anxieties, dreams, judgements and more, but it's there.
