# versions of myself

## 1: base scan
this is my body, or it was at that moment. A 3d scan intended to be a virtual representation of myself. but does it really? does it represent me?
it has no beard, where I usually wear one. my tattoo is there and I could add more. but it's hair doesn't move when it dances. it doesn't even vary.
this is not me, and only kind of represents me. see this body all you like, you won't find me there. it's missing too many pieces.


## 2 female
I have always struggled with masculinity. I reject the value and mere idea of its concept. And others have picked this up and made notice of it. They rejected, made fun, and alienated me. All because I have a, quote "strong feminine side". bullshit from society.
I didn't conform, and I still don't. I refuse. It means expecting society to expect differently from you and consciously unlearn cultural roles and patterns.
I wonder what if I was different? if I embrace that other side I feel closer to?


## 3 bowie
I vaguely remember the first time seeing the image of David Bowie as Ziggy Stardust on television. it was mesmerizing. seeing that someone could dress, act and be like that. Since then and for a long time I looked at androgyny as something to strive for. I was a child, so I didn't know how to go there, nor did it concern me that much.
but my genes drove me to another place. an ideal unfulfilled, at least on the physical space.

... but why me? why represent myself in a virtual space? does this body hold that much value it needs to be translated into the digital realm?
should I translate my body as it is?
can I amplify it? is there any value in doing so? can I perfect it? can I get rid of that which I hate?

finally, this representation completes this set: my physical body itself. so here I am.
The physical representation, the embodiment of my persona. Inside this fully textured and sometimes functional avatar you can find the essence of Nicolas. It's there, muddled between anxieties, dreams, judgements and more, but it's there.
But is this more valid than the previous ones? the fact that I'm "stuck" on it is not enough to say it is. if we use bodies to express ourselves, this one does only an OK job. my male coded body for this non binary person.
